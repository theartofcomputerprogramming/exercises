In *Chapter 1, Basic Concepts*, of *Fascicle 1, MMIX*

## Exercises

**1\.** *`[00]`* The binary form of 2009 is (11111011001)<sub>2</sub>; what is 2009 in hexadecimal?

**2\.** *`[05]`* Which of the letters {A, B, C, D, E, F, a, b, c, d, e, f} are odd when considered as (a) hexadecimal digits? (b) ASCII characters?

**3\.** *`[10]`* Four-bit quantities -- half-bytes, or hexadecimal digits -- are often called nybbles. Suggest a good name for two-bit quantities, so that we have a complete binary nomenclature ranging from bits to octabytes.

**4\.** *`[15]`* A kilobyte (kB or KB) is 1000 bytes, and a megabyte (MB) is 1000 kB. What are the official names and abbreviations for larger numbers of bytes?

**5\.** *`[M13]`* If ùõº is any string of 0s and 1s, let s(ùõº) and u(ùõº) be the integers that it represents when regarded as a signed or unsigned binary number. Prove that, if x is any integer, we have x = s(ùõº) if and only if x ‚â° u(ùõº)(modulo 2<sup>n</sup>) and -2<sup>n-1</sup> ‚â§ x < 2<sup>n-1</sup> where n is the length of ùõº

**6\.** *`[M20]`* Prove or disprove the following rule for negating an n-bit number in two's complement notation: "Complement all the bits, then add 1." (For example, `#0...01` becomes `#f...fe`, then `#f...ff`; also `#f...ff` becomes `#0...00`, then `#0...01`)

**7\.** *`[M15]`* Could the formal definitions of `LDHT` and `STHT` have been stated as s($X) ‚Üê s(M<sub>4</sub>[A]) * 2<sup>32</sup> and s(M<sub>4</sub>[A]) ‚Üê ‚åäs($X)/2<sup>32</sup>‚åã, thus treating the numbers as signed rather than unsigned

**8\.** *`[10]`* If registers $Y and $Z represent numbers between 0 and 1 in which the binary radix point is assumed to be at the left of each register, (7) illustrates the fact that `MULU` forms a product in which the assumed radix point appears at the left of register `rH`. Suppose, on the other hand, that $Z is an integer, with the radix point assumed at its right, while $Y is a fraction between 0 and 1 as before. Where does the radix point lie after `MULU` in such a case?

**9\.** *`[M10]`* Does the equation s($Y) = s($X) . s($Z) + s(rR) always hold after the instruction `DIV $X,$Y,$Z` has been performed?

**10\.** *`[M16]`* Give an example of `DIV` in which overflow occurs.

**11\.** *`[M16]`* True or false:

(a) Both `MUL $X,$Y,$Z` and `MULU $X,$Y,$Z` produce the same result in $X.\
(b) If register `rD` is zero, both `DIV $X,$Y,$Z` and `DIVU $X,$Y,$Z` produce the same result in $X.

**12\.** *`[M20]`* Although `ADDU $X,$Y,$Z` never signals overflow, we might want to know if a carry occurs at the left when adding $Y to $Z. Show that the carry can be computed with two further instructions.

**13\.** *`[M21]`* Suppose MMIX had no `ADD` command, only its unsigned counterpart `ADDU`. How could a programmer tell whether overflow occurred when computing s($Y)+s($Z)?

**14\.** *`[M21]`* Suppose MMIX had no `SUB` command, only its unsigned counterpart `SUBU`. How could a programmer tell whether overflow occurred when computing s($Y)-s($Z)?

**15\.** *`[M25]`* The product of two signed octabytes always lies between -2<sup>126</sup> and 2<sup>126</sup>, so it can always be expressed as a signed 16-byte quantity. Explain how to calculate the upper half of such a signed product.

**16\.** *`[M23]`* Suppose MMIX had no `MUL` command, only its unsigned counterpart `MULU`. How could a programmer tell whether overflow occurred when computing s($Y) * s($Z)?

**17\.** *`[M22]`* Prove that unsigned integer division by 3 can always be done by multiplication:

If register $Y contains any unsigned integer y, and if register $1 contains the constant `#aaaa aaaa aaaa aaab`, then the sequence
```
MULU $0,$Y,$1
GET $0,rH
SRU $X,$0,1
```
puts ‚åäy/3‚åã into register $X

**18\.** *`[M23]`* Continuing the previous exercise, prove or disprove that the instructions
```
MULU $0,$Y,$1
GET $0,rH
SRU $X,$0,2
```
put ‚åäy/5‚åã in $X if $1 is an appropriate constant

**19\.** *`[M26]`* Continuing exercises 17 and 18, prove or disprove the following statement: Unsigned integer division by a constant can always be done using "high multiplication" followed by a right shift. More precisely, if 2<sup>ùëí</sup> < z < 2<sup>ùëí+1</sup> we can compute ‚åäy/z‚åã by computing ‚åäa*y/2<sup>64+ùëí</sup>‚åã, where a = ‚åà2<sup>64+ùëí</sup>/z‚åâ, for 0  y < 2<sup>64</sup>

**20\.** *`[16]`* Show that two cleverly chosen MMIX instructions will multiply by 25 faster than the single instruction `MUL $X,$Y,25`, if we assume that overflow will not occur

**21\.** *`[15]`* Describe the effects of `SL`, `SLU`, `SR`, and `SRU` when the unsigned value in register $Z is 64 or more

**22\.** *`[15]`* Mr. B. C. Dull wrote a program in which he wanted to branch to location `Case1` if the signed number in register $1 was less than the signed number in register $2. His solution was to write
```
SUB $0,$1,$2
BN $0,Case1
```
What terrible mistake did he make? What should he have written instead?

**23\.** *`[10]`* Continuing the previous exercise, what should Dull have written if his problem had been to branch if s($1) was less than or equal to s($2)?

**24\.** *`[M10]`* If we represent a subset S of {0, 1, ..., 63} by the bit vector ([0 ‚àà S], [1 ‚àà S], ..., [63 ‚àà S]); the bitwise operations ‚à© and ‚à™ correspond respectively to set intersection (S ‚à© T) and set union (S ‚à™ T). Which bitwise operation corresponds to set difference (S ‚àñ T)?

**25\.** *`[10]`* The Hamming distance between two bit vectors is the number of positions in which they differ. Show that two MMIX instructions suffice to set register $X equal to the Hamming distance between v($Y) and v($Z)

**26\.** *`[10]`* What's a good way to compute 64 bit differences, v($X) ‚Üê v($Y) ‚à∏ v($Z)?

**27\.** *`[20]`* Show how to use `BDIF` to compute the maximum and minimum of eight bytes at a time:
```
b($X) ‚Üê max(b($Y), b($Z))
b($W) ‚Üê min(b($Y), b($Z))
```

**28\.** *`[16]`* How would you calculate eight absolute pixel differences |b($Y) - b($Z)| simultaneously?

**29\.** *`[21]`* The operation of saturating addition on n-bit pixels is defined by the formula y ‚àî z = min(2<sup>n-1</sup>, y + z). Show that a sequence of three MMIX instructions will set b($X) ‚Üê b($Y) ‚àî b($Z)

**30\.** *`[25]`* Suppose register $0 contains eight ASCII characters. Find a sequence of three MMIX instructions that counts the number of blank spaces among those characters. (You may assume that auxiliary constants have been preloaded into other registers. A blank space is ASCII code `#20`)

**31\.** *`[22]`* Continuing the previous exercise, show how to count the number of characters in $0 that have odd parity (an odd number of 1 bits)

**32\.** *`[M20]`* True or false: If C = A ‚¶ø B then C<sup>T</sup> = B<sup>T</sup> ‚¶ø A<sup>T</sup>. (See (11).)

**33\.** *`[20]`* What is the shortest sequence of MMIX instructions that will cyclically shift a register eight bits to the right? For example, `#9e 37 79 b9 7f 4a 7c 16` would become `#16 9e 37 79 b9 7f 4a 7c`.

**34\.** *`[21]`* Given eight bytes of ASCII characters in $Z, explain how to convert them to the corresponding eight wyde characters of Unicode, using only two MMIX instructions to place the results in $X and $Y. How would you go the other way (back to ASCII)?

**35\.** *`[22]`* Show that two cleverly chosen `MOR` instructions will reverse the left-to-right order of all 64 bits in a given register $Y.

**36\.** *`[20]`* Using only two instructions, create a mask that has `#ff` in all byte positions where $Y differs from $Z,`#00` in all byte positions where $Y equals $Z.

**37\.** *`[HM30]`* (Finite fields.) Explain how to use `MXOR` for arithmetic in a field of 256 elements; each element of the field should be represented by a suitable octabyte.

**41\.** *`[20]`* True or false:

a) The instructions `CSOD $X,$Y,0` and `ZSEV $X,$Y,$X` have exactly the same effect.\
b) The instructions `CMPU $X,$Y,0` and `ZSNZ $X,$Y,1` have exactly the same effect.\
c) The instructions `MOR $X,$Y,1` and `AND $X,$Y,#ff` have exactly the same effect.\
d) The instructions `MXOR $X,$Y,#80` and `SR $X,$Y,56` have exactly the same effect.
